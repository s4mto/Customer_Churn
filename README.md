# Employee Churn Analysis Project

Welcome to "Employee Churn Analysis Project". This is the second project of Capstone Project Series, which we will be able to build our own classification models for a variety of business settings.
Also we will learn what is Employee Churn?, How it is different from customer churn, Exploratory data analysis and visualization of employee churn dataset using matplotlib and seaborn, model building and evaluation using python scikit-learn package.
We will be able to implement classification techniques in Python. Using Scikit-Learn allowing we to successfully make predictions with the Random Forest, Gradient Descent Boosting , KNN algorithms.
At the end of the project, we will have the opportunity to deploy your model using Streamlit.

Our Streamlit's [link](https://arifatih-churn-analysis-capstone-project-churn-app-2-lz57g9.streamlitapp.com/) is here.
